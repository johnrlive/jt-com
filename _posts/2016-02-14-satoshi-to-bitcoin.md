[21's new payment channels](https://21.co/free/) will use [satoshis](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_%28unit%29) as a system resource. 

There are already about 2,000 Google searches per month for a satoshi to bitcoin converter. After a few searches I realized there isn't a simple converter out there, so I created [Satoshi to Bitcoin](http://satoshitobitcoin.co/).

It's a simple calculator that does satoshi to BTC and BTC to satoshi, with more to come! 

Visit [satoshitobitcoin.co](http://satoshitobitcoin.co/) to try it out.
