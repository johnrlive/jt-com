	<p>I’m Jordan Tuwiner.</p>
	<p>I grew up in the United States, but currently live in Israel where I serve in the army as a lone soldier. </p>
	
	<p>I founded <a href="http://orioles-nation.com/">Orioles-Nation.com</a> in high school and built it into one of the top Orioles websites. My passion for baseball slowly faded and I sold the site in October 2013.</p>

	<p>I’m a <a href="http://jordantuwiner.com/2015/01/03/for-bitcoin/">Bitcoin proponent</a>; it’s going to do to money what the internet did to communication and information. My favorite Bitcoin website is <a href="http://nakamotoinstitute.org/">The Nakamoto Institute</a>. I created <a href="http://bitcoinobituaries.com">Bitcoin Obituaries</a> and founded <a href="http://nothirdparty.com/">No Third Party</a>.</p>

	<p>I’m currently dreaming and planning my travels for after the army, while still trying to make the most of the rest of my service. Only 14 more months!</p>
